# Minsk

This is a Rust implementation of the **Minsk** programming language, originally
written in C# by Immo Landwerth (aka terrajobst on Github). I wanted to follow
along with his YouTube series to learn more about developing programming
languages, but I didn't want to just copy his code verbatim. Also, I'm not the
biggest fan of C# myself (it smells like Microsoft).
